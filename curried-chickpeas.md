# Curried Chickpeas

Soak **2 pounds of chickpeas** overnight in water with a **tablespoon
or so of olive oil**.

Bring a pot of **8 cups vegetable broth** to boiling, then put the
chickpeas into the broth.

Chop **2 onions** semi-finely and saut&eacute; in **olive oil** with
**some chopped ginger** until mostly cooked, then filter out the oil
and set aside.  Saut&eacute; some **chopped carrots** and **chopped
celery** similarly, using the oil from the first stage.  Once they're
partly cooked, put the onions and ginger back in, add ~3 heaping
tablespoons of **Madras curry powder**, and stir just enough to mix
the curry powder well.  (Don't stir for too long, because you don't
want to overcook these vegetables -- they're about to get put into
simmering broth for 5 hours or so.)

Pour the saut&eacute;ed vegetables into the broth with the chickpeas.
Bring to a simmer and let simmer for appx 5 hours, stirring
occasionally.  An hour or two in, add **2 heads of star anise**.

Near the end, add **a bunch of fresh mint leaves, chopped or torn**,
remove some of the broth if desired, and add a cup or two of **coconut
milk**.  Stir to mix, and let the coconut milk be in the broth long
enough for the broth to return to original temperature.

Serve over rice.
