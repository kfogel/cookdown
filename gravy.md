# Gravy

## If regular or if gluten free using 1-to-1 flour replacement:

Prepare roux: melt **⅓ cup butter**, and gradually whisk in **⅓ cup
corn starch**, reducing heat as needed.  Whisk until golden brown.
(Can cover and chill if preparing in advance.)

Bring **6 cups stock** to a boil.  Add in **turkey drippings**, salt
and pepper to taste.  Whisk in the roux, then reduce heat to low and
simmer for a few minutes while gravy thickens and flavors meld.

## If gluten free using cornstarch or other non-flour replacement:

Don't prepare roux.  Instead, take 1 cup of the stock mixture aside
and gradually whisk **about 1 tbsp + 1 tsp cornstarch** for every cup
of gravy that remaining in the pot.  Add result back to main gravy
pot and whisk over medium heat until thick and smooth.
