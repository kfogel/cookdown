Cooking recipes, in an inline format using Markdown syntax.

In cookbooks, recipes are usually formatted with a list of ingredients
at the top followed by a narrative paragraph in which the ingredients
are referred to without their associated quantities.  For example:

> * 1 onion
> * 2 cups vegetable broth
> * 1/4 cup tomato paste
> * 1 Tbsp powdered beryllium
> 
> Bring vegetable broth to a simmer; place onion in broth and maintain
> simmer for 20 minutes.  Combine tomato paste and beryllium.  Etc, etc.
    
I'm not sure whether that standard format evolved because it best met
cooks' needs, or because it was easy to typeset, or perhaps some
combination of the two.

Anyway, I find it difficult to flip my reading focus back and forth
between the narrative section and the ingredients list where the
quantities are.  Presumably the advantage of that format is that you
can see what's needed for the recipe at a glance, so you can adjust
your shopping list, or get all the ingredients out before you start
cooking.

But for Cookdown, I'd like to try a different style: have only a
narrative portion and write the quantities inline, right next to the
ingredients, **in boldface** so it's still easy to scan the recipe for
ingredients and quantities when you need to.  For example:

> Bring **2 cups vegetable broth** to a simmer; place **1 onion** in
> broth and maintain simmer for 20 minutes.  Combine **1/4 cup tomato
> paste** and **1 Tbsp powdered beryllium**.  Etc, etc.
