# cookdown

Cooking recipes, in an inline format using Markdown syntax.

In cookbooks, recipes are usually formatted with a list of ingredients
at the top followed by a narrative paragraph in which the ingredients
are referred to without their associated quantities.  For example:

> * 1 onion
> * 2 cups vegetable broth
> * 1/4 cup tomato paste
> * 1 tbsp powdered beryllium
> 
> Bring vegetable broth to a simmer; place onion in broth and maintain
> simmer for 20 minutes.  Combine tomato paste and beryllium.  Etc, etc.
    
I'm not sure whether that standard format evolved because it best met
cooks' needs, or because it was easy to typeset, or perhaps through
some combination of the two.  Anyway, I find it difficult to flip my
reading focus back and forth between the narrative section and the
ingredient list.  The advantage, presumably, is that you can see
exactly what is needed for the recipe at a glance, so you can adjust
your shopping list, or get all the ingredients out before you start
cooking.

For Cookdown, I'd like to try a different style: just have a narrative
portion, but write the quantities inline next to the ingredients, **in
boldface** so it's still easy to scan the recipe for ingredients and
quantities if you need to prepare a shopping list.

> Bring **2 cups vegetable broth** to a simmer; place **1 onion** in
> broth and maintain simmer for 20 minutes.  Combine **1/4 cup tomato
> paste** and **1 tbsp powdered beryllium**.  Etc, etc.
