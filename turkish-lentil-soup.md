# Turkish Lentil Soup

(Thanks to @kreidberg.)

Finely chop **1 large onion** and saut&eacute; in **olive oil** in a
big pot until translucent.  While onion is saut&eacute;eing, rinse **2
cups red lentils**.

Add to potc: **16 cups vegetable broth**, lentils, **1 cup finely
ground bulgur wheat**, **1/4 cup tomato paste**, **1 tsp red pepper
flakes**.

Bring to a simmer and let simmer for appx 1 hour, stirring
occasionally to prevent sticking.  At end, add **2 tbsp dried mint**
-- the key is to crumble the mint finely between your palms to release
all the delicious flavors.  Add more olive oil to taste (about 1/4 cup
is good).

If feeling fancy, serve with fresh mint or lemon slices.

Important things:

* use good vegetable broth
* use good quality dried mint, make sure to crumble it, and make sure
  to use the full 2 tbsp.
