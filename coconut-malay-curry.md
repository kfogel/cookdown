For the paste:

1. Pound the following ingredients into a paste (this is my favorite part -- for flavor, best to use whole spices and grind with a morter + pestle or dedicated coffee grinder)

   * 4 **shallots** or **red onions**
   * ~5 small or 1-2 big **dried red chilis** (I use the mild dried ones from whole foods - these are mostly for color and a bit of heat)
   * 2 **garlic cloves**
   * 1.5 tsp **coriander seeds**
   * 1 tsp **cumin**
   * 1 tsp **fennel seeds**
   * 1/4 tsp **tumeric powder**
   * 1-3 **cloves** (recipe calls for 1, but I always add a few)
   * Pinch of **cinnamon** (I use a bit of cinnamon bark instead)
   * 1-cm knob of **ginger**
   * 1 stalk of **lemon grass** (the tender part) (I often get lazy and leave this out -- fine without it)
   * **Salt and sugar** to taste (I find that sugar and salt are essential for bringing out the flavors)
   * **Cilantro** on top is a nice touch, if you go that way**
   * (optional) A **ground candlenet or other nut** as a thickener (if you want to get fancy -- I don't, but do add dried coconut milk powder if I used low-fat coconut milk and want to add richness to it)

For the substance:

    1 can coconut milk (normal or lite - I usually use lite as nice
    for simmering and then add dried coconut milk at the end if I
    want to add more body to it)
    One small pumpkin, roasted and cut into chunks
    Or brown meat chicken legs + thighs + potatoes

Method:

2) Heat oil and fry the spice paste over low to medium heat for
about 6 minutes until aromatic (don’t burn it - I sometimes get lazy
and only do it for a minute or two)
5) Add coconut milk and whatever you’d like for the substance:

    If adding pumpkin - should be cooked/semi-cooked already, but
    you’ll want to let it simmer for a while to absorb the flavor of
    the curry. Try not to over-cook pumpkin otherwise it gets mushy.
    If adding potato - you can add raw potatoes and simmer in the
    curry until done, or add boiled potatoes
    If adding chicken, the recipe says to cook the chicken in
    advance, but I just add it the curry and boil at low heat until
    done

6) Simmer on a low heat- note that this dish is better when served
the next day as the flavors blend and mellow.  I rarely do this, but
always find the leftovers to be even tastier.
