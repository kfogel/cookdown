# Coconut Malay Curry (a.k.a. Pumpkin Curry)

Ingredients:  

For  the Spice  Paste:   

    Shallots x 4 (or a red onion)
    Dried Red Chillies (~5 small or 1-2 big - I use the mild dried
    ones from whole foods - these are mostly for color and a bit of
    heat)
    Garlic clove x ~2
    1.5 tsp Coriander Seeds
    1 tsp Cumin
    1 tsp Fennel Seeds
    1⁄4 tsp Tumeric Powder
    1-3 cloves  (recipe calls for 1, but I always add a few)
    Pinch of Cinnamon (I use a bit of cinnamon bark instead)
    Ginger 1-cm knob
    Lemon Grass 1 stalk, tender part (I often get lazy and leave this
    out - fine without it)
    Salt and sugar to taste  - I find that sugar and salt are
    essential for bringing out the flavors.
    *Cilantro on top is a nice touch, if you go that way
    If you want to get fancy, use a ground candlenut or other nut as
    a thickener - I don't, but do add dried coconut milk powder if I
    used low-fat coconut milk and want to add richness to it


For the substance:

    1 can coconut milk (normal or lite - I usually use lite as nice
    for simmering and then add dried coconut milk at the end if I
    want to add more body to it)
    One small pumpkin, roasted and cut into chunks
    Or brown meat chicken legs + thighs + potatoes


Method:  

1) Pound the  spices into a paste (this is my favorite part - for
flavor, best to use whole spices and grind with a morter + pestle or
dedicated coffee grinder)
2) Heat  oil and fry  the spice paste  over low to medium  heat for
about 6 minutes  until aromatic (don’t burn it - I sometimes get lazy
and only do it for a minute or two)
5) Add coconut milk and whatever you’d like for the substance:

    If adding pumpkin - should be cooked/semi-cooked already, but
    you’ll want to let it simmer for a while to absorb the flavor of
    the curry. Try not to over-cook pumpkin otherwise it gets mushy.
    If adding potato - you can add raw potatoes and simmer in the
    curry until done, or add boiled potatoes
    If adding chicken, the recipe says to cook the chicken in
    advance, but I just add it the curry and boil at low heat until
    done


6) Simmer on a low heat- note that this dish is better when served
the next day as the flavors blend and mellow.  I rarely do this, but
always find the leftovers to be even tastier.
