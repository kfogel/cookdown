# Pulled Pork

Credit: @lkreidberg

Put around **8 lbs of bone-in pork shoulder** (it might be called
"pork butt" in the store) in a slow cooker on low in the morning.
Cook for approximately 6 hours and then switch to warm, OR cook on low
for 9 hours.

Take out bones and fat using two forks.

Put in **Stubb's Smoky Mesquite BBQ sauce**, and shred fully with two
forks.

(Okay, that last ingredient is kind of suspicious.  I mean, I'm sure
the stuff is great, but maybe there needs to be a description of how
to make homemade BBQ sauce here too?)
