# Buttermilk Pancakes

Sift together in a bowl:

  - **1 cup all-purpose flour**
  - **1 Tbsp sugar**
  - **1 tsp baking powder**
  - **1/2 tsp baking soda**
  - **1/4 tsp salt**

Separately, mix together **1 egg**, **1 cup buttermilk**, **2 Tbsp vegetable oil**.

Beat the liquid mix into the dry ingredients until batter is smooth.
Be careful not to overbeat.

Cook on a greased griddle until top is full of tiny bubbles and
underside is brown.  Flip and brown the obverse.

    Notes:

    Batter may be frozen for a very long time.

    If multiplying, reduce the proportion of eggs.  This recipe tends
    to err on the side of an overly eggy and thick pancacke anyway.

    If adding berries, add them to the individual cakes at at cooking
    time.  Don't put them in the batter, because at room or fridge
    temperature they'll go bad faster than the batter will.
