# Cranberry Sauce

Rinse **1 bag of cranberries** with cool water.  Place cranberries in
pot and add **1 cup of cranberry juice** (or some other juice, but
cranberry juice is normal).  Add **1 cup of maple syrup**, and *a few
tablespoons of freshly-juiced orange juice** (could be lemon juice
and/or orange zest).  Stir it all.  Bring to a boil, then reduce to
medium low heat and cook for about 10-20 minutes or until it's thick;
the berries should burst and break down.

Remove from heat and let cool.  Pour into a container and refrigerate.
It can stay in the fridge for 3-4 days, or freezer for a couple of
months.
